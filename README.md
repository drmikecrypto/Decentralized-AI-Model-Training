# Decentralized AI Model Training

A decentralized AI training infrastructure built on the Sonic network, participating in the Sonic Boom program. This project enables distributed machine learning model training while utilizing Sonic's blockchain technology for secure and efficient AI model development.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project aims to revolutionize AI model training by:
- Decentralizing the training process across multiple nodes
- Reducing computational costs through shared resources
- Ensuring data privacy and security
- Leveraging blockchain for model verification
- Creating an incentivized training ecosystem

## üöÄ Key Features

- Distributed AI model training across nodes
- Blockchain-based model verification
- Secure data handling and encryption
- Incentive mechanism for node operators
- Automatic resource optimization
- Gas Monetization (GasM) integration
- Real-time model progress tracking

## üõ† Technical Stack

- Python 3.8+
- Sonic Smart Contracts
- PyTorch/TensorFlow
- Web3.py
- IPFS
- GPU Acceleration Tools

## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended)
- Sonic network access
- IPFS node
- Required Python packages:
  - torch/tensorflow
  - web3
  - ipfshttpclient
  - numpy
  - cryptography
  - aiohttp

## üîß Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/drmikecrypto/decentralized-ai-training.git
cd decentralized-ai-training
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure your environment:
```json
{
    "web3": {
        "rpc_url": "YOUR_RPC_URL",
        "private_key": "YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY",
        "contract_address": "CONTRACT_ADDRESS",
        "contract_abi_path": "abi.json"
    },
    "ipfs": {
        "host": "/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/5001",
        "cache_dir": "./ipfs_cache"
    },
    "training": {
        "batch_size": 32,
        "learning_rate": 0.001,
        "epochs": 100
    }
}
```

## üí° How It Works

1. Model Distribution
   - AI models are split into trainable components
   - Components are distributed across network nodes
   - Training tasks are assigned based on node capacity

2. Training Process
   - Nodes receive training data and model components
   - Local training occurs on each node
   - Results are verified through blockchain consensus

3. Model Aggregation
   - Trained components are collected and verified
   - Results are merged into the final model
   - Performance metrics are recorded on-chain

## üîí Security Features

- End-to-end encryption
- Secure model weight transfer
- Blockchain-based verification
- Node reputation system
- Anti-tampering mechanisms
- Secure key management
